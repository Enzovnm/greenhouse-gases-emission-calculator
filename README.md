# 🌍GHG Emissions Calculator

This python application was developed for a school project, which it's aiming to approach GHG Emissions topics.
So, I developed a python script that the users send datas about  their enterprise category, consume of oil and energy. Thus, the Application send it to Climatiq API and 
and retrieves with the GHG emission calculated.
